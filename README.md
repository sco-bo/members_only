##Members-Only App

###Purpose
This app is an exercise in user modeling, authentication, and authorization. 

###Approach
Users who are 'members' of the club are able to write posts with nice things about the 'non-members'. Non-members can see the nice posts, but they cannot see who wrote them, only members can see that information.
